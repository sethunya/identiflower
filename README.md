### some more information
Due to the limits of the community license for access to Clarifai, this webapp is currently only capable of recognizing ten different kinds of flower. I believe it does a decent job regardless.

Recognized types:
* Anemone
* Aster
* Dahlia
* Daisy
* Hibiscus
* Hydrangea
* Iris
* Larkspur
* Rose
* Tulip

Please accept my most sincere of apologies if your favorite was not included.
